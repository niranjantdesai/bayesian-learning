- SGLD code: we started from this notebook https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vV5bsp7o6SyhAXErHwUC1FYxb-9Dc9SK but modified it to use a third party SGLD optimizer obtained from [PySGMCMC ](https://pysgmcmc.readthedocs.io/en/pytorch/index.html).
- PBP: We used the author's code as-is, provided on [Github](https://github.com/HIPS/Probabilistic-Backpropagation).
